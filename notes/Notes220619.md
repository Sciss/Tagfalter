# Notes 19-Jun-2022

- [X] crypsis: envelope ; duration based on spatial positions
- [X] space-timbre amplitude could vary between a min/max range (as low as 6 dB)
- [X] place gap after biphase-send before recording
- [ ] after a period (e.g. hour), re-start accel-rec based on current spatial positions
- [ ] continuously run biphase-rcv ? then release any process when detecting global comm
- [ ] add another silent stage, that is entered at random times
- [ ] accel-play: should we use compression / limiter?
- [ ] space-timbre: skip communication frequencies
- [ ] accel: filter communication frequencies?
- [ ] after space-pos update: send individual frequencies
